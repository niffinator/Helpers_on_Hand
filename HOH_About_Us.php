	<center><p>	This idea has been brewing for several years while my partner and I have been contemplating
	retirement. His concern is that he’ll need something to do. We’ve talked about task rabbits, but
	that seemed random. He is often called upon by others for small tasks and loves to help. Sometimes
	we get the sense that people feel awkward or guilty asking directly. Then the task rabbit idea
	morphed into a call to arms among the neighbors, but wouldn’t it be cool if the neighbors that
	could help let us know ahead of time. And what if we are the ones needing help?! We needed
	a signup sheet of sorts...</p></center>
